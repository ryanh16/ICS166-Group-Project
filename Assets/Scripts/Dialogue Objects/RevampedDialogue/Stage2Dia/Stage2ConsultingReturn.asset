  - 0\I'm sorry, can I return this bus pass? I got it the other day but I thought
    it was going to last for a year, not an academic year.
  - 1\Actually, I'm not allowed to refund bus passes that last for that long. Your
    best bet would be to talk to a supervisor about it.
  - 0\Oh...okay. Is there a supervisor around?
  - 1\Unfortunately they're not in yet. They usually come in around 9:30 if you'd
    like to wait for them.
  - 0\Uh...I think I'll just come back later. Sorry to bother you.
  - 0\--Sigh-- (I guess I'll just have come back after my class. I really hope I
    can get my money back.)
