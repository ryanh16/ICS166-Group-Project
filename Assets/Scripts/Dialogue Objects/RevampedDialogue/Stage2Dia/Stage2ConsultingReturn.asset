  - 0\Hello can I return this bus pass? I got it the other day but I was under the
    understanding it was a year not a month.
  - 1\So I actually can't refund a bus pass that was purchased for that long a quantity.

  - 0\Oh ok. Can I talk to them?
  - 1\Unfortanetly they are not in yet. They usually come in around 9:30 if you want
    to wait for them.
  - 0\Uh..I'll just come back later. Thanks anyways...
