  - 0\Hi, sorry, I'm here to return this bus pass. I bought it under the assumption
    it was for a year but it expires in less than 3 months. Is there anything you
    can do?
  - 1\Hm...
  - 1\I can process the refund for you, but you'll still be charged for the amount
    of time that you had it. In your case, it would be for a day. Is that alright?
  - 0\Sure, thank you. I'm sorry for making this difficult.
  - 1\It's okay, you don't need to apologize, these kinds of things happen. Your
    refund should be processed within 2-3 business days and your current pass will
    be invalidated.
  - 0\Alright, thanks again...
