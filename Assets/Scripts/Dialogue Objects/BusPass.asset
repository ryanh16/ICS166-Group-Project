  - 0\Oh, I remember this card.
  - 0\I bought this card at the beginning of the Spring quarter because I needed
    to take the bus to campus.
  - 0\That was the first day of the quarter and I had a class at 8 AM that morning,
    but I wanted to buy it before the class, so I went to campus early that day.
  - 0\I arrived at the campus around 7:10 and found out the Transportation center
    opens at 7:45.
  - 0\The transportation center was very old, there wasn't even a chair outside the
    office. I had to stand there and wait for half an hour.
  - "0\\When the office finally opened, I rushed in and bought the 1-year bus pass
    very quickly because I didn\u2019t want to be late for the first class."
  - "0\\So here comes the consequences: I didn\u2019t ask or even notice that the
    1-year time period stands for one academic year."
  - 0\This meant that I could only use this card for the next 3 months while I paid
    the full price for a 1-year bus pass.
  - '0\So the next morning I came to the Transportation center again trying to refund
    this card.  '
  - '0\When the office finally opened, the officer inside told me that they only
    sell this card but do not have the right to refund it, '
  - "0\\and only the County\u2019s transportation center\u2019s people can help me
    with this. "
  - "0\\I spent another day commuting to the County\u2019s transportation center,
    explaining everything and filling out several forms required for the refund.  "
  - 0\After an entire day, I finally returned that 1-year bus pass but was charged
    at a daily rate for the past few days.
