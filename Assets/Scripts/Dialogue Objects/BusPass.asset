  - 0\Oh, I remember this card.
  - 0\I bought this card at the beginning of Spring Quarter because I needed to take
    the bus to campus.
  - 0\That was the first day of the quarter and I had a class at 8 AM that morning,
    but I wanted to buy it before class, so I went to campus early that day.
  - 0\I arrived on campus at around 7:10AM and found out that the Transportation
    Center opens at 7:45AM.
  - 0\The Transportation Center was very old, there wasn't even a chair outside the
    office. I had to stand there and wait for twenty minutes.
  - "0\\When the office finally opened, I rushed in and bought the 1-year bus pass
    because I didn\u2019t want to be late for class."
  - "0\\Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t ask or even notice that the 1-year time period
    only lasted until the end of the academic year."
  - 0\This meant that I could only use this card for the next 3 months while I paid
    the full price for a 1-year bus pass.
  - 0\So the next morning, I came to the Transportation Center again trying to refund
    this card.
  - "0\\When the office finally opened, the employee inside told me that they didn't
    have the ability to refund it, and that only the Orange County Transportation
    Center\u2019s people could help me with that."
  - "0\\I spent another day commuting to the county\u2019s Transportation Center,
    explaining everything and filling out several forms required for the refund."
  - 0\After an entire day I finally returned that 1-year bus pass, but I was charged
    at a daily rate for a few days.
